# Biometric Crime Detection System

**Project Title:** Biometric Crime Detection System Using Facial Recognition and Fingerprint Matching

**Author:** Shawad

**Institution:** [Your Institution]

**Supervisor:** [Supervisor Name]

**Course/Code:** WASF299



## Executive Summary

This project implements a prototype Biometric Crime Detection System that uses facial recognition and fingerprint matching to identify suspects by comparing input biometric data against a stored criminal database. The system includes a Flask web interface for registering suspects and performing matches, a fingerprint matching module using OpenCV SIFT-based feature matching, a facial recognition pipeline based on the `face_recognition` library, and a live webcam recognition script for real-time surveillance.
